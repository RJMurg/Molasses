# Molasses

Molasses is a stupidly simple Chrome Extension that will set the TU Dublin Clubs and Socs portal to dark mode.
This happens automatically when visiting the portal.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository.
5. The extension should now be installed and active.
